# Ising Model Simulation Package

## Introduction

- This program simulates ising model in arbitrary dimensions using the checkerboard algorithm. Helper functions to measure physical properties like the correlation length and equilibrium time are provided.

- Please read this readme file and install relevant python packages before running.

## Working examples

- A [report](https://github.com/carpediemmlf/ising_model/blob/master/report/report_preprint/apssamp.pdf) with code examples on determining the critical exponents, magnetic hysteresis effects etc.

## Installation

- All packages can be installed using the pip3 install command. Packages needed are listed below.
  + numpy
  + scipy
  + scikit-learn
  + random
  + statsmodels
  + time
  + itertools
