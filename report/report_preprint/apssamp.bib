	abstract = {The fourth-order cumulant of the magnetization, the Binder cumulant, is determined at the phase transition of Ising models on square and triangular lattices, using Monte Carlo techniques. Its value at criticality depends sensitively on boundary conditions, details of the clusters used in calculating the cumulant, and symmetry of the interactions or, here, lattice structure. Possibilities to identify generic critical cumulants are discussed.},

	abstract = {Scientific and economic interest has recently turned to smaller and smaller magnetic structures which can be used in hard disk drives, magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), and other novel devices. For nanomagnets the geometric shape of the object becomes more important than other factors such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy . the smaller the object, the more strongly the shape anisotropy affects the hysteresis loop.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}We investigate the micromagnetic behaviour of ferromagnetic samples of various geometries using numerical methods. Finite differences and finite elements are used to solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert and Brown's equations in three dimensions. Simulations of basic geometric primitives such as cylinders and spheres of sub-micron size orders provide hysteresis loops of the average magnetisation, and additionally our computations allow the study of the microscopic configuration of the magnetisation. We show different mechanisms of vortex penetration for these geometries, and investigate part-spherical geometries whose magnetisation pattern demonstrates qualities of other primitives.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}Developing this further, we calculate the hysteresis loops for a droplet shape - a part-sphere capped with a half-ellipsoid. This resembles the shapes formed by some chemical self-assembly methods, a low-cost and efficient way of creating a commercially viable product. When examining the magnetic microstructure of this geometry we find different types of vortex behaviour, and reveal the dependence of this on the physical characteristics of the droplet.{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}We also examine the hysteresis loops and magnetic structures of other geometries formed through the self-assembly method such as antidots:honeycomb-like arrays of spherical holes in a thin film. We show magnetisation patterns and comparison between experimental and computed magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements.}

@article{10.1371/journal.pone.0063935,
	abstract = {We construct a stochastic SIR model for influenza spreading on a D-dimensional lattice, which represents the dynamic contact network of individuals. An age distributed population is placed on the lattice and moves on it. The displacement from a site to a nearest neighbor empty site, allows individuals to change the number and identities of their contacts. The dynamics on the lattice is governed by an attractive interaction between individuals belonging to the same age-class. The parameters, which regulate the pattern dynamics, are fixed fitting the data on the age-dependent daily contact numbers, furnished by the Polymod survey. A simple SIR transmission model with a nearest neighbors interaction and some very basic adaptive mobility restrictions complete the model. The model is validated against the age-distributed Italian epidemiological data for the influenza A(H1N1) during the season, with sensible predictions for the epidemiological parameters. For an appropriate topology of the lattice, we find that, whenever the accordance between the contact patterns of the model and the Polymod data is satisfactory, there is a good agreement between the numerical and the experimental epidemiological data. This result shows how rich is the information encoded in the average contact patterns of individuals, with respect to the analysis of the epidemic spreading of an infectious disease.},

@article{BLOCK20101549,
	abstract = {A Modern Graphics Processing unit (GPU) is able to perform massively parallel scientific computations at low cost. We extend our implementation of the checkerboard algorithm for the two-dimensional Ising model [T. Preis et al., Journal of Chemical Physics 228 (2009) 4468â€“4477] in order to overcome the memory limitations of a single GPU which enables us to simulate significantly larger systems. Using multi-spin coding techniques, we are able to accelerate simulations on a single GPU by factors up to 35 compared to an optimized single Central Processor Unit (CPU) core implementation which employs multi-spin coding. By combining the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with the Message Parsing Interface (MPI) on the CPU level, a single Ising lattice can be updated by a cluster of GPUs in parallel. For large systems, the computation time scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs used. As proof of concept we reproduce the critical temperature of the 2D Ising model using finite size scaling techniques.},
